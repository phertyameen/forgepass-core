**The ForgePass contributor dashboard — your Builder Passport, made visible**

This is the web application where contributors connect their Stellar wallet, view their Builder Passport, explore achievement badges, and browse the ecosystem's contributor network. It is also the public-facing interface through which any visitor can look up and verify a contributor's on-chain reputation.

> Lives in [`forgepass-core`](../../) — the ForgePass core monorepo.

## What This App Does

The app is the human-readable layer on top of the ForgePass system. Behind the scenes, reputation data lives in Soroban contracts and a PostgreSQL database. This application makes it accessible, navigable, and useful to contributors and projects alike — no blockchain knowledge required.

### For Contributors

- **Connect your Stellar wallet** via the Freighter browser extension to claim and view your passport.
- **See your Trust Score** with a full breakdown of which signals contributed to it and how much each one weighs.
- **Browse your achievement badges** — soulbound NFTs minted on Stellar for milestones like your first merged PR, first deployed contract, or first completed bounty.
- **View your contribution timeline** — a chronological record of verified activity across GitHub, Soroban, SCF, GrantFox, and the Stellar network.
- **Manage your privacy settings** — choose which signals are publicly visible on your profile.

### For Projects & Visitors

- **Public contributor profiles** — any Stellar address can be looked up to view its verified passport, score, and badges.
- **Passport Explorer** — browse and filter contributors across the ecosystem by skill, Trust Score, project history, and region.
- **Ecosystem health dashboard** — an aggregate view of contributor growth, active hubs, and how the builder network is expanding over time.
